   - Verify successful registration and auto-login

3. **Login Testing**
   - Test with demo accounts (admin/manager/employee)
   - Test with invalid credentials to verify error handling
   - Test password visibility toggle
   - Verify successful login redirects to appropriate dashboard

4. **Role-based Dashboard Testing**

6. Implement proper logging
7. Add rate limiting and security headers

### Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
FLASK_ENV=production
```
